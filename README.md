This repository contains all sources of IcedTeaWeb. 

## About IcedTeaWeb
IcedTeaWeb is an open source implementation of [JSR-56](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56) that is better known as Java Web Start.

## Development origin
The project was formerly hosted as part of the [icedtea.classpath.org](https://icedtea.classpath.org) project but moved to github.

The 1.7 and 1.8 release branches of IcedTeaWeb will be migrated to GitHub for fixing bugs in the previews releases.
Next to this a new project structure will be established in the `master` branch.
Here the project will be migrated to Maven and more usage of Java 8 APIs will be introduced the next month.
Based on this IcedTeaWeb can be transformed to a general WebStart / JNLP API that JDK and tool vendors can use to offer JNLP functionality.
A good example is [OpenWebStart](https://dev.karakun.com/webstart/) that will be based on IcedTeaWeb.

All issues of the former Bugzilla issue tracker at classpath.org were already migrated to GitHub and marked by the `bugzilla-import` label.
