Each file in directory simple must follows hierarchy conventions and is compiled/jared 
 automatically into server's working directory and content of resources likewise. 
 The name of jnlp is independent, and there can be even more jnlps for each future jar.
Directories are honored in srcs and in resources, but noty in testcases.
Directories in signed hande their content in similar way as simle's content is handled,
 but in addition final jars are signed with simple testkey.
Files in advanced directory have to care about themselves, but even those can have some
 parts inside simple directory, so some parts of them are processed automatically.
 There are three reproducers – simpletest1, simpletest2 and deadlocktest, which tests 
 test’s suite itself and serve as examples of behaviour.

Directory "signed" is listed in Makefile.am. You can specify as much to-be-signed
directories as you want. And jars in each of those signed directories will be 
signed  by their's own unique key (number of signed directories == number of certificates).
Do not forget to add each this directory into list n Makefile.am
