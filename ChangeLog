2014-08-05  Andrew Azores  <aazores@redhat.com>

	Small bug fix (security hole) for previous PR1769 patch. This patch closes
	a hole where very specifically formulated partially signed applets could
	maintain fully signed privileges (all-permissions), even for their
	unsigned components.
	* netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/runtime/JNLPClassLoader.java
	(initializeResources): ensure that the 'signing' field is properly set for
	partially signed applets and that applets with an external main class are
	properly detected.

2014-08-01  Andrew Azores  <aazores@redhat.com>

	Fixed support for signed applets which specify the Permissions attribute
	as "sandbox" in their manifests. These applets are now properly run
	sandboxed automatically, rather than requiring the user to click the
	"Sandbox" run button.
	* netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/runtime/JNLPClassLoader.java
	(JNLPClassLoader): manifest attributes checking and security settings
	moved inside initializeResources
	(initializePermissions): renamed (initializeReadJarPermissions). Redundant
	null-check removed
	(initializeResources): do not set entries in jarLocationSecurityMap until
	after prompting the user on whether to run the applet as well as
	performing manifest attribute checks. A new Collection (validJars) is used
	to hold available and valid JARs between discovering the JARs and applying
	any security settings to the them
	(initializeManifestAttributesChecker): new method
	(getJnlpFileCodebase): new method, extracted from initializeResources
	(SecurityDelegateImpl.setRunInSandbox): throw exception if already forced
	to run in sandbox, rather than if already prompted
	* netx/net/sourceforge/jnlp/runtime/ManifestAttributesChecker.java
	(isLowSecurity): new method
	(checkAll): Extended Applet Security on Low disables all manifest checks
	except for Permissions
	(checkPermissionsAttribute): do not skip checking if Extended Applet
	Security is Low. Remove try/catch on setRunInSandbox call as this is now
	supported.
	(checkApplicationLibraryAllowableCodebaseAttribute): do not display dialog
	prompts on low security, allow the applet to run without prompt
	* tests/netx/unit/net/sourceforge/jnlp/runtime/JNLPFileTest.java
	(newSecurityAttributesTest): set JAR manifest to have Permissions:
	all-permissions, since this is a JNLP and JAR is signed and so 'sandbox'
	is not actually allowed
	* tests/test-extensions/net/sourceforge/jnlp/mock/DummyJNLPFile.java:
	properly initialize 'security' field rather than overriding getSecurity
	* tests/test-extensions/net/sourceforge/jnlp/mock/DummyJNLPFileWithJar.java:
	same

	Fix for regression due to PR1513 fix. ClassLoader was too optimistic about
	finding codebase main-classes and so the not-all-signed dialog would
	appear even for applets that were entirely broken and could not be loaded
	at all.

	will be there

	Plugin debug can now be controlled from itw_settings, in same way java side.
	For now ICEDTEAPLUGIN_DEBUG on the debug in same way as deployment.log
	itw-settings property. Individual logging streams are controlled by
	deployment.log.{headers,file,stdstreams,system} System and file are not yet
	fully done (same as java side in this moment). Streams are true, all others 
	false by default.
	* plugin/icedteanp/IcedTeaNPPlugin.cc: initialized variables new bool
	variables (debug_initiated), (plugin_debug_headers), (plugin_debug_to_file),
	(plugin_debug_to_system) as false and (plugin_debug_to_streams) as true.

	shortcuts (is_debug_on) (is_debug_header_on) (is_logging_to_file)
	(is_logging_to_stds) (is_logging_to_system) implemented to access properties.
	* plugin/icedteanp/IcedTeaParseProperties.h: above methods declared.
	* plugin/icedteanp/IcedTeaPluginUtils.h: (PLUGIN_{ERROR,DEBUG}) methods
	adapted headers/debug/streams logic as described in title. Headers made more 
	informative (like java side)
	* tests/cpp-unit-tests/IcedTeaPluginUtilsTest.cc: 
	TEST(PLUGIN_DEBUG_ERROR_PROFILING_debug_on) extended to
	TEST(PLUGIN_DEBUG_ERROR_PROFILING_debug_on_headers_off).
	TEST(PLUGIN_DEBUG_ERROR_PROFILING_debug_off)  extended to
	TEST(PLUGIN_DEBUG_ERROR_PROFILING_debug_off_headers_off), and new tests
	TEST(PLUGIN_DEBUG_ERROR_PROFILING_debug_on_headers_on) 
	TEST(PLUGIN_DEBUG_ERROR_PROFILING_debug_off_headers_on) (100x slower then

	Changed allocation of small, fixed-size buffers to stack-based 
	allocations. Changed occurrences of sprintf to the safer function
	snprintf, added buffer information. While unlikely to change
	functionality, snprintf adds an extra check to prevent buffer
	overflows.

	* tests/jnlp_tests/signed/CacheReproducer/testcases/CacheReproducerTest.java: 
	 as javaws have now integrated splash, I have changed this test to lunch
	 javaws -Xclearcache with -headless to skip this logo (although it is 
	not fatal fr testrun itself)
	* tests/jnlp_tests/simple/AppletTest/resources/appletAutoTests.html: 
	 this html file is lunched during tests run in browser and stdout of 
	 lunched applet is examined. Is lunched with slow resources to test
	 spalshscreen
	* tests/jnlp_tests/simple/AppletTest/resources/appletViewTest.html: this 
	test html file is dedicated to manual lunch and let user to look how the

	* tests/netx/jnlp_testsengine/net/sourceforge/jnlp/ServerAccess.java: 
	 Main server launcher was modified to support lunching of browser, 
	 stdout listteners and for slowing download of resources to provide time
	 for watching splash screen (main) was rewritten to provide free port OR
	 run server in-D specified directory on custom or default port - very
	 useful for debuging reproducers
	 (getIndependentInstance) can now run also on specified port and (or) directory
	 (USED_BROWSER_COMMAND) new constant handling value of -D property to 
	set browser = "used.browser.command";
