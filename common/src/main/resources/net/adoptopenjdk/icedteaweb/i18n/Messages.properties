PEdescL1=is a GUI application with small command line support to view and edit applet security policy settings used by the IcedTea-Web implementation \
of<B> javaws </B>and the <B> browser plugin. </B>It is intended as a simpler, easier to use, and more accessible alternative \
to the standard <B> JDK Policy Tool. </B>Administrators and power users who need fine grained control over policy files should probably use \
Policy Tool instead of PolicyEditor.
PEdescL2=If executed without any arguments, no file is opened, and saving the file will result in a prompt on where to save it. Otherwise, if a file path is given as \
a command line argument, then that file path will be opened and parsed as policy file.
PEexampleL1=Show GUI and opens the default policy file.
PEexampleL2=Show the GUI editor with no file opened.


# javaws man (note, spaces (especially the one around markup) are important due to man pages markup). Only bold  tag is now recognized by ReplacingTextFormatter.
JWSintro= - a Java Web Start client
JWSdescL1=is an implementation of a JNLP client. It uses a JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) file to securely run a remote Java application or a Java applet. \
This implementation of {0}is from the IcedTea project and is based on the NetX project.
JWSdescL2=A JNLP file is an xml file that describes how to securely run a remote Java application or a Java applet.
JWSoptionsL1=When specifying options, the name of the jnlp file can be after the command, the -jnlp option, an option with no arguments, or after an argument with an option that takes one argument. A html file that launches a jnlp can be specified after the -html option.
JWSoptionsL2=The jnlp-file can either be a url or a local path.
JWSoptionsL3=The JNLP file should only be specified once, whether as a main argument, after -jnlp or through an html file.
JWSoptionsTitle1=Run options:
JWSoptionsTitle2=Control options:
JWSexampleL1=Shows basic help and about informations.
JWSexampleL2=Shows basic help and about informations in terminal only.
JWSexampleL3=Will start {0} application, originally from {1}, without downloading it, without headers check and in forced single VM.

PBOFile=Specifies a policy file path to open. If exactly one argument is given, and it is not this flag, it is interpreted as a file path to open, as if this flag was given first. This flag exists \
mostly for compatibility with Policy Tool.
PBODefaultFile=Specifies that the default user-level policy file should be opened. This is the file which is normally used by IcedTea-Web to make decisions about custom policies and permissions \
for applets at runtime, unless configured otherwise.
PBOCodebase=Specifies an applet codebase URL. This can be used with the other selector options to select a policy entry upon opening the editor; \
if no such identifier exists then it will be created and then selected.
PBOSignedBy=Specifies a certificate alias for a certificate stored in the keystore. This can be used with the other selector options to select a policy entry upon opening the editor; \
if no such identifier exists then it will be created and then selected.
PBOPrincipals=Specifies class name/principal name pairs (space-separated) for the policy entry identifier. This can be used with the other selector options to select a policy entry upon opening the editor; \
if no such identifier exists then it will be created and then selected.

PEHelpDialogContent=<html><center><h1>PolicyEditor Help</h1></center>\
PolicyEditor allows you to secure java applets or applications you want to run \
  with the specified permissions you decide to give it. \
<center><h2>Features</h2></center>\
<ul>\
  <li/><b>Accessible:</b> through use of keyboard only, mouse only, or both\
  <li/><b>Customize:</b> by specifying any permissions you decide to choose\
  <li/><b>Secure:</b> your applets and applications to use only the permissions you specify\
  <li/><b>Manage:</b> codebases and their respective permissions you set\
</ul>\
  PolicyEditor works by specifying a codebase and checking the permissions you wish to grant to \
  the current Java applet or application. To run the applet/application with only the specified permissions, \
  use the sandbox button or specify sandbox mode in the manifest.\
 <br><br>\
  Within PolicyEditor there are many additional actions. Right-clicking or pressing \
  enter (after tabbing to the group) on a permission group with a small arrow or chevron \
  beside it will expand or collapse the given permission checkbox group. Other notable features are \
  the ability to copy and paste a set of permissions into a new codebase, allowing for \
  quick access to a user specified default permissions group. \
  Also, you''re not limited to the predefined checkbox permissions. By accessing \
  Custom Permissions through the view menu, you can add any customized permissions. \

<h1>Help for Extended applet security - itw-settings, files and structures, dialogue</h1> \
<p> \
Extended Applet Security refers to security features for unsigned applets. Traditionally, only signed applets required user confirmation and unsigned applets ran automatically. This is represented by the ''low security'' setting. Unsigned applets must be allowed or disallowed individually on ''high security'' (the default), and additionally do not run at all on ''very high security''. In theory, unsigned applets can safely run automatically. In practice, however, any vulnerability in the Java security sandbox will prevent this from being true. \
</p> \
<p> \
To do so it uses  the <b>Security Level</b> main settings switch rules in the tables of <b>Custom definitions</b> and <b>Global definitions</b><br/> \
You can read much more about development of (and help us to improve!) this feature at <a href="{3}">dedicated IcedTea-Web page</a> \
</p> \
<A name="level"><h2>Security Level</h2></A> \
<p> \
Its a main switch for "extended applet security". Its value is commonly stored in users_home/.icedtea/deployment.properties, but can be enforced via global settings in /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties or JAVA_HOME/lib/deployment.properties under the key <b>deployment.security.level</b><br/> \
<li/><b>Disable running of all Java applets</b> - stored as <i>DENY_ALL</i> - No applet will be run<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
No applet will be allowed to run. However the Java virtual machine will always be executed (and an error screen with reason appear instead of applets). To disable Java completely you can uninstall IcedTea-Web or disable it in your browser (if supported). The tables with records are of course ignored. \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>Very High Security</b> - stored as <i>DENY_UNSIGNED</i> - No unsigned applets will be run<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
No applet <b>unsigned</b> will be allowed to run (and an error screen with reason will appear instead of such applets). The tables with records are of course again ignored. \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>High Security</b> - stored as <i>ASK_UNSIGNED</i> - User will be prompted for each unsigned applet<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
All <b>unsigned</b> applets will be tested against the tables below if they should be allowed or forbidden to run. If they are not matched in the table then the user is prompted and the decision is stored in <a href="#table">tables</a> below. If the user denies the applet, an error screen with reason appears and the applet does not run. If the user allows applets to run, the user can choose to save this decision and whether to allow just one applet or a whole group of applets (see <a href="#dialogue"><b>Dialogue</b> paragraph </a>below). \
<br/>This is default behavior. \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>Low Security</b> - stored as <i>ALLOW_UNSIGNED</i> - All, even unsigned, applets will be run<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
All applets <b>even unsigned</b> will be allowed to run. User will not be warned and the tables with records are of course again ignored. \
</blockquote> \
You need to press <b>ok</b> or <b>apply</b> button to make the changes take effect. \
</p> \
 \
 \
<h2><A name="table">Table with recorded actions</A></h2> \
<p> \
<h4>Custom x Global table</h4> \
After each action in <b>High Security</b> dialogue the record is added to, or updated in, the table or configuration file. Commonly in users file - home/.icedtea/.appletTrustSettings - "Custom definition" panel.<br/> \
But superuser can specify default behavior in /etc/.java/deployment/ .appletTrustSettings - "Global definition" panel.<br/> \
<h4>"Syntax"</h4> \
<li/><b>Action</b> - Desired behavior when applet is matched<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<li/><b>Always trust this applet</b> - This unsigned applet will always be run in High Security Security Level. It is stored as <i>A</i> in .appletTrustSettings<br/> \
<li/><b>Never trust this applet</b> - This unsigned applet will never be run in High Security Security Level. It is stored as <i>N</i> in .appletTrustSettings<br/> \
<li/><b>Visited and allowed</b> - When the user is asked about this applet again, a note that this applet was already trusted in past will be displayed. It is stored as <i>y</i> in .appletTrustSettings<br/> \
<li/><b>Visited and denied</b> - When user will be asked about this applet again, he will see information that this applet was already denied in past. It is stored as <i>n</i> in .appletTrustSettings<br/> \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>Date</b> - date of last action on this item (read only item)<br/> \
<li/><b>Document base</b> - is the page from which the applet was requested. It is actually a regular expression to match a specific URL. See about regular expressions and their usage <a href="#regexes">lower</a><br/> \
<li/><b>Code base</b> - is the URL where an applets code came from. It is actually a regular expression to match a specific URL. See about regular expressions and their usage <a href="#regexes">lower</a><br/> \
<li/><b>Archives</b> - coma separated list of archives with applet''s code. Can be empty if source code are just classes or group of applets is allowed<br/> \
<br/> \
When you change a value in the table, its effect is immediate. \
<h4>Controls of tables</h4> \
<p> \
<li/><b>Delete</b> - deletes items as specified in combo box on side<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<li/><b>selected</b> - removes all selected items. Key <b>Del</b> does the same. Default behavior. <b>Multiple selections</b> allowed. Selection can be inverted by button even more on side<br/> \
<li/><b>all allowed (A)</b> - removes all permanently trusted records<br/> \
<li/><b>all forbidden (N)</b> - removes all permanently forbidden records<br/> \
<li/><b>all approved (y)</b> - removes all previously (temporarily) trusted records<br/> \
<li/><b>all rejected (n)</b> - removes all previously (temporarily) denied records<br/> \
<li/><b>all</b> - will clear the table<br/> \
<br/> \
<b>Ask me before action</b> - switch to ask before each deletion (in bulk) or not to ask. Asking dialogue can be pretty long, so if you do not see the buttons, just press <b>Esc</b> \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>Show full regular expressions</b> - Disable or Enable filtering of quotation marks \Q\E in code/document base columns. About regular expressions see more <a href="#regexes">lower</a><br/> \
<br/> \
<li/>Filtering in table(s)<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<li/><b>Show only permanent records</b> - Shows only permanently allowed <b>(A)</b> or denied <b>(N)</b> records. Default behavior<br/> \
<li/><b>Show only temporarily decided records</b> - Shows only once allowed <b>(y)</b> or denied <b>(n)</b> informative records.<br/> \
<li/><b>Show only permanently allowed records</b> - Shows only permanently allowed <b>(A)</b> records<br/> \
<li/><b>Show only permanently denied records</b> - Shows only permanently denied <b>(N)</b> records<br/> \
<li/><b>Show only temporarily allowed records</b> - Shows only once allowed <b>(y)</b> informative records.<br/> \
<li/><b>Show only temporarily denied records</b> - Shows only once denied <b>(n)</b> informative records.<br/> \
</blockquote> \
</p> \
<li/><b>Add new row</b> - will add new, exemplary filled, row with current date and empty archives  <br/> \
<li/><b>Validate table</b> - will test if table can save, load, and if each value is valid:<br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<li/><b>Action</b> - is one of A,N,y,n<br/> \
<li/><b>Date</b> - is valid date<br/> \
<li/><b>Code base and document base</b> - are valid <a href="#regexes">regular expressions</a> or empty<br/> \
<li/><b>Archives</b> - coma separated list of archives or empty<br/> \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>Test url</b> - In two dialogues (in two steps) will let you enter document base and codebase, and then try to match them against all records. All matching items are returned! Last values are remembered> \
<li/><b>Move row down/up</b><br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
Order of rows is important. First matched result is returned (permanent have priority). So you can prioritize your matches using these buttons. <br/> \
For example, if you \Qhttp://blogs.com/\E.* regular expression to allow all applets on http://blogs.com, then it must be AFTER your \Qhttp://blogs.com/evilJohn\E.* regular expression forbidding all applets from blog of hacker evilJohn. \
</blockquote> \
</p> \
<p> \
<h2><A name="dialogue">Dialogue</A></h2> \
If <a href="#level"><b>High Security</b></a> is set, and a new unsigned applet is hit then the dialogue is shown asking you to allow it or deny it. You can also <b>choose</b> if you want to allow or deny this applet <b>every-time</b> (A or N) you encounter it or for <b>just one run</b> (y,n).<br/> \
You can also select to trust or deny (again temporarily or permanently)  <b>all</b> the applets from <b>same, exact, codebase</b>. If you are visiting one page, which has various applets on various documents then this is a choice for you.<br/> \
If you decide not to allow remembering your decision, then just a temporary record is made. If you revisit a page, a small green or red label will inform you about your last decision.<br/> \
Once you select <b>remember</b> your decision, the dialog will <b>never appear again</b>.  But you can <b>edit</b> your decision in <b>itw-settings application <a href="#table">table</a></b> (packed with IcedTea-Web). If you change your decision to temporary one (n,y)  or delete its row, the dialogue will appear again. Of course you can switch also from Always to Never or vice versa. \
<br/> \
The dialogue always mentions the page on which an applet is displayed, and the URL from which it comes.  There is also a hint, if you have ever visited this applet saying if you have allowed or rejected it in the past <br/> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<h3>Controls</h3> \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<li/><b>Remember this option</b> - If set, then dialogue will never be shown for this applet or page again. \
<blockquote cite="" > \
<li/><b>For applet</b> - Exact applet will be allowed or denied \
<li/><b>For site</b> - All applets from this place will be allowed or denied  \
</blockquote> \
<li/><b>Proceed</b> - Applets, as selected above will be allowed \
<li/><b>Cancel</b> - Applets, as selected above will be forbidden \
</blockquote> \
Be aware to "proceed" + "Remember this option" + "For site" on pages you do not know! It can make you vulnerable! \
</blockquote> \
</p> \
<p> \
<h2><A name="regexes">Regular expressions</A></h2> \
IcedTea-Web extended applet security - uses a powerful matching engine to match exact (sets of) applets. Base stone is <b>Quotation</b> of URL \Q\E and <b>wildchars</b> like .* or .? or more.<br/> \
This was designed to suits the need to block or allow exact pages. The best is to show some examples:<br/> \
N 12.12.2012 .* \Qhttp://blogs.com/evilJohn\E.* <br/> \
N 12.12.2012 \Qhttp://blogs.com/goodJohn/evilApplet.html\E.* \Qhttp://blogs.com/goodJohn/\E goodJohnsArchive.jar <br/> \
A 12.12.2012 \Qhttp://blogs.com/\E.* \Qhttp://blogs.com/\E.* <br/> \
N 12.12.2012 .* \Qhttp://adds.com\E.* <br/> \
Y 12.12.2012 .* \Qhttp://www.walter-fendt.de/ph14_jar/\E <br/> \
<br/> \
<i>So this table, created 12.12.2012:<br/></i> \
<li/>Forbid all stuff which have some code on http://blogs.com/evilJohn pages<br/> \
<li/>Forbidding also one exact applet from http://blogs.com/goodJohn/ with archive goodJohnsArchive.jar<br/> \
<li/>Allowing all (other) applets from http://blogs.com/ but only when displayed also on http://blogs.com/<br/> \
<li/>Forbidding all applets with code saved on  http://adds.com (except on http://blogs.com/ - to have forbidden http://adds.com also on http://blogs.com/, this (http://adds.com) record must be above blogs record)<br/> \
<li/>And finally allowing all nice physical applets on  walter-fendt''s pages <br/> \
<br/> \
Note - the date saved in .appletTrustSettings has a not so nice format, but I left this for now...<br/> \
<br/> \
