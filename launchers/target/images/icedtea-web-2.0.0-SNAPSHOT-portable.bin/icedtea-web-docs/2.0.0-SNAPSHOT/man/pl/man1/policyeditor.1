.SH NAME


.PP
policyeditor - view and modify security policy settings for 
.B javaws 
and the 
.B browser plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS


.PP

.B  policyeditor 
.br
.B policyeditor [-file] 
policy_file
.SH DESCRIPTION


.PP

.B policyeditor 
is a GUI application with small command line support to view and edit applet security policy settings used by the IcedTea-Web implementation of
.B  javaws 
and the 
.B  browser plugin. 
It is intended as a simpler, easier to use, and more accessible alternative to the standard 
.B  JDK Policy Tool. 
Administrators and power users who need fine grained control over policy files should probably use Policy Tool instead of PolicyEditor.
.br

.br
If executed without any arguments, no file is opened, and saving the file will result in a prompt on where to save it. Otherwise, if a file path is given as a command line argument, then that file path will be opened and parsed as policy file.
