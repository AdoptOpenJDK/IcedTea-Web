/**
 * This class tracks the downloading of various resources of a
 * JNLP file to local files in the cache. It can be used to
 * download icons, jnlp and extension files, jars, and jardiff
 * files using the version based protocol or any file using the
 * basic download protocol (jardiff and version not implemented
 * yet).
 * <p>
 * The resource tracker can be configured to prefetch resources,
 * which are downloaded in the order added to the media
 * tracker.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Multiple threads are used to download and cache resources that
 * are actively being waited for (blocking a caller) or those that
 * have been started downloading by calling the startDownload
 * method.  Resources that are prefetched are downloaded one at a
 * time and only if no other trackers have requested downloads.
 * This allows the tracker to start downloading many items without
 * using many system resources, but still quickly download items
 * as needed.
 * </p>
