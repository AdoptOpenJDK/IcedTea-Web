    // to the foreground application (the currently the approach
    // since some apps need their classloader as event dispatch
    // thread's context classloader).

    // todo: use a custom Permission object to identify the current
    // application in an AccessControlContext by setting a side
    // effect in its implies method.  Use a custom
    // AllPermissions-like permission to do this for apps granted
    // all permissions (but investigate whether this will nuke
    // the all-permission optimizations in the JRE).

    // todo: does not exit app if close button pressed on JFrame
    // with CLOSE_ON_EXIT (or whatever) set; if doesn't exit, use an
    // WindowListener to catch WindowClosing event, then if exit is
    // called immediately afterwards from AWT thread.

    // todo: deny all permissions to applications that should have
    // already been 'shut down' by closing their resources and
    // interrupt the threads if operating in a shared-VM (exit class
    // set).  Deny will probably will slow checks down a lot though.

    // todo: weak remember last getProperty application and
    // re-install properties if another application calls, or find
    // another way for different apps to have different properties
    // in java.lang.System with the same names.
